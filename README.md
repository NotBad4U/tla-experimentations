## Missionaries and Cannibals problem

In the [missionaries and cannibals problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem), three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people, under the constraint that, for both banks, if there are missionaries present on the bank, they cannot be outnumbered by cannibals (if they were, the cannibals would eat the missionaries). The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board. And, in some variations, one of the cannibals has only one arm and cannot row.

## Token Ring

Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of food. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.
The problem was designed to illustrate the challenges of avoiding deadlock, a system state in which no progress is possible.
